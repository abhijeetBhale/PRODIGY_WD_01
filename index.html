            <div class="demo-div">
                <p>The Ford GT40 is a legendary racing car born from a rivalry with Ferrari. Developed to conquer the
                    grueling 24 Hours of Le Mans, this American-built machine defied expectations. With its low,
                    aerodynamic
                    profile and powerful V8 engine, the GT40 dominated the race for four consecutive years, solidifying
                    Ford's place in motorsport history and becoming an iconic symbol of engineering prowess and American
                    determination.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>The Birth of a Legend</h3>
            <div class="demo-div">
                <p>The Ford GT40 is a testament to American engineering and determination. Its origins lie in a fierce
                    rivalry with Ferrari, who dominated the 24 Hours of Le Mans race. Determined to break the Italian
                    stronghold, Ford assembled a team of talented engineers and drivers. Their goal was ambitious: to
                    build
                    a car capable of not only winning Le Mans but dominating it.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Engineering Excellence</h3>
            <div class="demo-div">
                <p>The GT40 was a marvel of engineering. Its low, aerodynamic profile was designed to cut through the
                    air
                    with minimal resistance. Under the hood lay a powerful V8 engine, providing the necessary horsepower
                    to
                    compete with the best. The car's chassis was built for endurance, capable of withstanding the
                    grueling
                    demands of the 24-hour race. The result was a machine that was as beautiful as it was formidable.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Conquering Le Mans</h3>
            <div class="demo-div">
                <p>In 1966, Ford achieved the impossible. The GT40 not only won Le Mans but dominated the podium, taking the first three positions. This incredible feat marked the beginning of an era. Over the next four years, Ford secured an unprecedented four consecutive victories, cementing the GT40's place in motorsport history. This triumph was a watershed moment for the American automotive industry, proving that they could compete and win against the best in the world.</p>
